[Where to put .ogg file in the external storage such as SD Card]
  Make directory named `wasuramoti_reader' and make subdirectory. And then put .ogg files in it.
  Ogg files must be named in format of <name>_%03d_%d.ogg and placed in the directory named `<name>'.
  For example the Simo-no-Ku of 7th fuda which is read by `inaba' must be placed in:
