[Where to put .ogg file in the external storage such as SD Card]
  Make directory named `wasuramoti_reader' and make subdirectory named `inaba' or whatever.
  Then put the .ogg files in it.
  Ogg files must be named in format of <name>_%03d_%d.ogg when the directory name is `<name>'.
  First %03d indicates fuda number (refer to AllFuda.scala).
  The second %d indicates 1 for Kami-no-Ku(upper phrase), and 2 for Shimo-no-Ku(lower phrase).
  For example the Simo-no-Ku of 7th fuda which is read by `inaba' must be placed in:
    `wasuramoti_reader/inaba/inaba_007_2.ogg'
  The <name>_000_1.ogg is optional. Because sometimes Kami-no-Ku of Joka might be concatenated in <name>_000_2.ogg.

[Where to put .ogg file inside the application]
  The naming convension of the *.ogg file of the reader is as follows:

    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_000_1.ogg (optional)
    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_000_2.ogg (lower phrase of Joka)
    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_001_1.ogg (upper phase of Akinotano)
    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_001_2.ogg (lower phase of Akinotano)
    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_002_1.ogg (upper phase of Harusugite)
    ...
    src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_100_2.ogg (lower phase of Momoshikiya)

  However, scripts/make_package.sh makes symbolic link from `${READER_DIR}/<name>' to `src/main/assets/reader/<name>',
  and builds *.apk package. Therfore we should use this script.

[How to compile]
  Requirements:
    openjdk 6 (or some other Java JDK)

  Before executing the following command, you have to execute `cd src/main/jni/libogg-*/ && ./configure && make`
  Just compile:
   $ sbt compile
  Make a *.apk package for debug: 
   $ sbt android:package-debug
  Run in device:
   $ sbt android:start-device
  Make a *.apk package for release:
