[Where to put .ogg file in the external storage such as SD Card]
  Make directory named `wasuramoti_reader' and make subdirectory named `inaba` or whatever.
  Then put the .ogg files in it.
  Ogg files must be named in format of <name>_%03d_%d.ogg when the directory name is `<name>'.
  First %03d indicates fuda number(refer to AllFuda.scala).
  The second %d indicates 1 for Kami-no-Ku(upper phrase), and 2 for Shimo-no-Ku(lower phrase).
  For example the Simo-no-Ku of 7th fuda which is read by `inaba' must be placed in:
    `wasuramoti_reader/inaba/inaba_007_2.ogg'
  The <name>_000_1.ogg is optional. Because sometimes Kami-no-Ku of Joka might be concatenated in <name>_000_2.ogg.

[Where to put .ogg file inside the application]
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_000_1.ogg (optional)
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_000_2.ogg
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_001_1.ogg
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_001_2.ogg
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_002_1.ogg
  ...
  src/main/assets/reader/<name>/<name>_100_2.ogg
