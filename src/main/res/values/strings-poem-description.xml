    <item>---</item>
    <item>Waiting for morning in the lookout shed, I watch over the harvest alone. The gaps in the weave of the roof are large, and my kimono, wet from the night mist, never seems to dry.</item>
    <item>It seems that spring has already given way to summer. It is said that in the summertime the white robes can be seen hanging out to dry at the foot of Mt. Amanokaguyama. At the moment I see white robes so bright that they stun the eyes.</item>
    <item>The autumn night is as long as the tail and wings of the peacock. Like the pheasant pairs who sleep apart, I spend this night in lonely solitude.</item>
    <item>Approaching the shores of the Tago-no-ura, I look to the horizon to catch a glimpse of Mt. Fuji, swathed in mystical white. Snow keeps falling at its glorious summit.</item>
    <item>In the depths of the faraway mountains, I step on beds of fallen leaves. I hear a deer calling for his mate, and a feeling of sadness pierces my heart.</item>
    <item>The bridge of the Milky Way is said to be formed of the wings of the magpie. The bridge of the imperial court, a match for its beauty, is shrouded in frost, and the shocking white makes the night seem darker still.</item>
    <item>Looking up at the sky I see the moon shining brightly in all its glory. It strikes a nostalgic chord in me as I remember that moon over Mt. Mikasa at Kasuga of Nara.</item>
    <item>My little hermitage lies to the southeast of the capital, and it’s such a lonely place that I’m visited by deer, and the quietude is just the way I like it. But people seem to think I’ve taken refuge in Uji because I’ve grown tired of the world.</item>
    <item>I feel I’ve faded, just like the cherry blossoms that have lost their color. Watching the endless rain, I get lost in the sadness of my thoughts of past loves lost.</item>
    <item>This place is rightfully called “the meeting place.” People traveling from Kyoto to the east, people coming home to Kyoto, people who know each others’ faces, and people who don’t?they all meet and say goodbye, and say goodbye and meet again.</item>
    <item>Oh, fisherman in the boat over there! Tell my love in Kyoto that my boat has left, headed for the islands out on the vast ocean.</item>
    <item>Winds high in the sky, close the pathway through the clouds! These angels who have descended to the earth are about to take leave, but I want to see them dance a bit more.</item>
    <item>Like the Minano River that grows deeper as it flows from the peaks of Mt. Tsukuba, my feelings deepen with time, and now I am hopelessly in love.</item>
    <item>Like the wild-looking dye patterns of Mutsu, my heart is in complete chaos. Is this chaos my fault? No, this is entirely your fault.</item>
    <item>I have come to the spring meadows to pick herbs for you. The spring snow falls endlessly on my kimono sleeve.</item>
    <item>I take leave of you now to travel to Inaba, but if you tell me that you’ll wait for me like the pine trees that grow there, I’ll be sure to come back soon.</item>
    <item>To make a ruby red dye from the fallen leaves that cover the Tatsuta River: this is something unheard of even in the time of the mythical gods, when mysterious occurrences happened all the time.</item>
    <item>A bit like the waves that pound the shores of Sumiyoshi, my mind is pervaded by thoughts of love alone throughout the day, and even the night?why is it so? I am now so absorbed that I avoid others.</item>
    <item>I cannot stand even the thought of not seeing you, even for the shortest length of time?even for a time as short as the joints on the reeds that grown in Naniwa Bay.</item>
    <item>The rumors keep us from meeting, and to me this is like giving up my own life. Like the solitary channel markers of Naniwa Bay, I would gladly give up, this life to see you.</item>
    <item>You say that you want to see me now, but I must wait in anticipation for the long autumn nights, for alas we cannot meet until the moon of the first light of September rises.</item>
    <item>The autumn vegetation starts to wither when the fierce mountain winds blow violently down the mountain, and the spectacle is no less than a tempest.</item>
    <item>I’m overcome with sadness at the sight of the fall moon. It seems that the autumn comes just to make me melancholy.</item>
    <item>Because I left in a hurry on this journey, I failed to even bring something to offer at the shrine. Please accept the dazzling blanket of changing leaves over Mt. Tamukeyama as an offering from my heart.</item>
    <item>If this kadsura vine from Mt. Osaka carries the secret message that we are to meet and spend the night together, I will turn it over in my hands in full view of others without them knowing, wondering how I can get to you. If only it were as easy as tugging on this vine.</item>
    <item>Oh, changing leaves of the peaks of Mt. Ogura: only you understand my heart. If you have the chance to welcome the emperor just once more, please keep your leaves until then.</item>
    <item>Like the changing views surrounding the Izumi River that flows through the meadows of Mikanohara, I am not sure when I saw you, when I met you, or even if it was not all a dream, and yet my heart aches to no end.</item>
    <item>The mountain villages have a lonely air throughout the seasons, but in winter they seem a thousand times more desolate. No one passes through these parts during this time, and the grass and trees all wither away?the very thought leaves me melancholy.</item>
    <item>The ground is covered in a blanket of pure white with the first frost, and we can’t find the brilliant white chrysanthemums underneath. But let us try and pick them anyway.</item>
    <item>Ever since the morning we parted, when the dull moon hung wanly in the sky and you seemed so cold, nothing has been harder for me than the dawn.</item>
    <item>When the dawn broke after a lovely night, the snow of Yoshino is so brilliant one that one could mistake it for the moon at dawn.</item>
    <item>A dam on the river cutting through mountain ravines created by the wind is, upon a closer look, a pile of fallen autumn leaves that cannot be swept down the stream.</item>
    <item>On this gentle sunny spring day, I wonder why only the cherry blossoms cannot stay calm, instead scattering every which way on the ground.</item>
    <item>Who can I call my friend at this old age? The only ones who know I’ve lived this long are the pines of Takasago, and even they have not been my friends for long.</item>
    <item>You may have changed your mind for all I know, but the plum blossoms of this village are blooming with that same heavenly scent of long ago.</item>
    <item>The summer nights are so short, when you think the night’s only just begun, it’s already dawn. Where in the clouds is the moon hiding?</item>
    <item>The stunning white dew sits beautifully atop the meadow leaves, blown endlessly by the autumn wind. The blazing white dew droplets look as if they are held ever so tenuously on a string, and they’re scattered across the meadow this fall.</item>
    <item>I really don’t care what becomes of me now that you have forgotten about us. It is I who pity you, because you who will lose your life to divine punishment for breaking the promise that we made before God.</item>
    <item>I wonder why I must endure this heartbreak?why, as if I were a reed in the meadows, I must keep on enduring, why I miss you so very much.</item>
    <item>I promised myself that no one would know of my love for you, but in the end I couldn’t hide it in my face, and people even inquire of me what has happened.</item>
    <item>I wanted to let my love for her grow secretly and quietly in my heart, but my feelings are already the talk of the town.</item>
    <item>We promised each other that we would always be there for each other, as we wrung the sleeves of our kimonos wet with our tears. We swore that Sue-no-Matsuyama would be inundated with waves if we ever broke our promise, and so we for Sue-no-Matsuyama we vow that our love will never change.</item>
    <item>I pined with all my heart to cast eyes on you, but once I did it was agonizing. The pain I felt longing to meet you pales in comparison to the despair I feel now.</item>
    <item>If there is no chance on earth for us to meet, then there is no use in blaming either one of us.</item>
    <item>I know of no one who would pity me in my bleak circumstances. I am afraid that I am fated to die feeling empty, with nothing but unrequited passion.</item>
    <item>Like a boatman trying to negotiate the water of the Yura strait without his paddles, floating directionless on the seas, I have no way of knowing where my love will take me.</item>
    <item>No one bothers to come to this forlorn-looking house wrapped in vines?until autumn, my long-awaited visitor, arrives at last.</item>
    <item>Like the waves that are smashed up against the rocky coast by forceful winds, your coldness pierces my heart and I feel nothing but heartache.</item>
    <item>Like the beacon fires lit by the guards of the imperial court, my heart burns with passion at night, but goes cold with the sunrise. The days are so painful that I feel my soul itself may disappear.</item>
    <item>Though I felt I would gladly give up my life for you, after seeing your face I now have reason to want to live long.</item>
    <item>I want to tell you only of how much I love you, but I cannot say even that. You have no idea whatsoever of how I feel?you have no clue that my heart burns for you like the grasses of Mt. Ibuki.</item>
    <item>The dawn comes and another day passes, and though I know we will meet again, still the sight of the morning light pains my heart.</item>
    <item>I wonder if you know how long the night seems as I wait for you alone, wishing you were here. Alas, I do not think you know.</item>
    <item>You once said that you would never forget me, but as I have no way of knowing that your feelings will not change, I would like to end this life today.</item>
    <item>Many years have passed since the sound of the waterfall of Daikakuji Temple was last heard, and the rumor of its existence is now all that remains of it.</item>
    <item>I feel that my life is nearly to its end. In honor of the place I am going, I wish to see you just once more again before I go to that place.</item>
    <item>You were gone before I was able to see whether it was really you that I was seeing after all this time: you vanished like the moon behind the cloud.</item>
    <item>A soft little rustling of the bamboo can be heard when the breeze sweeps through Ina near Mt. Arima, reminding me of you. Even if you forget me completely, I can never forget you.</item>
    <item>As I was waiting in vain for you, I at last fall asleep alone, watching the moon set over the western sky.</item>
    <item>The Ikuno road to Mt. Oeyama is so far away that I have not yet been to Amanohashidate, and my mother has sent me no letters.</item>
    <item>The double-blossoming cherry blossoms, once the pride of Nara, are now more beautiful than ever here in the court of Kyoto.</item>
    <item>You can try to fool me by crowing like a rooster before the dawn to get through unseen, but you will never get past Osaka, for I will surely see you there.</item>
    <item>There is just one thing I wish to tell you in person, and not through someone else, and that is that everything is finished between us. I must find a way to tell you.</item>
    <item>In the morning, as the morning light slowly dawns, the fog over the Uji River lifts little by little, and I see the wicker fishnets artfully drawn over the rapids.</item>
    <item>My sleeves never dry from the constant tears I cry for that cold-hearted person, and yet these sleeves do not rot away. Yet it is hard for me to accept that my name is being tainted by the rumors of my love.</item>
    <item>I think of you as someone very close to me, and I hope you feel the same nostalgic way for me. Oh, mountain cherry blossoms, there is no one else in this world who knows me as you do.</item>
    <item>I regret the loss of my name over reasons as small as the moment I spent with you lying next to me, a moment fleeting as a spring night.</item>
    <item>I have no choice but to go on living in this world of suffering, somehow lying to myself. In difficult times, I will remember tonight’s astonishingly beautiful moon.</item>
    <item>The maple tree leaves of Mt. Mimuro are scattered everywhere by the fierce gusts of wind, and now they cover the Tatsuta River like a gorgeous brocade of silk.</item>
    <item>I’m so lonely that I venture out of my hermitage to take in the views, but perhaps because my despair is so great, everything else looks as forlorn as I do in this autumn hour of twilight.</item>
    <item>When the sun goes down, the autumn breeze touches the fields in front of my home, enticing the rice stalks to whisper a lovely little song. The cool autumn night touches my heart too, as I sit in my country home of straw.</item>
    <item>I refuse to get wet my kimono sleeves wet in the famed waves of Takashi-no-hama. In the same way, I cannot hear what you are saying, as you betray my trust in your dalliances, which are no secret. I do not wish my sleeves to be wet with tears.</item>
    <item>Mountain cherry blossoms are blooming wildly on the faraway peaks. Mist of the nearby mountains, stay clear today so that we may behold the cherry blossoms in the distance.</item>
    <item>I prayed with all my heart to the Hatsuse Kannon that I could win you. I didn’t pray that you would become as cold as the winds billowing down from the hills of Hatsuse.</item>
    <item>The promise you made to me was as beautiful as the due on the rush, and you implored me to have faith in you no matter how hard it was. Yet, alas, another autumn is going by and I have yet to cast eyes on you.</item>
    <item>Out on the open sea in my boat, I looked to the gently curved horizon, and beheld a wave so massively white that I mistook it for clouds in the distance.</item>
    <item>The rapids rush over a steep plummet, and the water is spliced into two currents by a rock in the center. Just like those two streams will meet once again, we two as well will have the chance to look upon each other in the future.</item>
    <item>The sad cries of the plover can be heard as they make their way over the straits from Awaji Island, which can be seen during the day, yet is shrouded in darkness at night. I wonder how many times the night watchman at Suma has been awakened and tantalized by those cries.</item>
    <item>The autumn wind blows and the moon peeks out from amongst the clouds in the great expanse of the sky. Its pure beauty and brightness pierce my heart.</item>
    <item>I have no way of knowing your heart, you who promised to love me forever, and so I am lost in confusion like the tangles of my hair on this morning after you have taken leave of me.</item>
    <item>The solitary song of a bird comes from somewhere in the night sky as dawn approaches, but looking in that direction I cannot find it, and only the moon is here to comfort me.</item>
    <item>For so long I have thought of my unrequited love, and though I remain alive it is too much for me to bear, and my life passes in day after melancholy day.</item>
    <item>I wonder if there is no way to be free of the despair and agony of this earth. Even in this mountain hermitage, far from the mundane world, the deer still cries longingly for his mate.</item>
    <item>If one lives to see old age, I wonder if one can look back on the hard times with the soft edge of nostalgia, just as I reminisce about past trials and tribulations today.</item>
    <item>The night passes ever so slowly as I think of the one I love, wishing she were here. Even the crack in the doorway where I wait for her to appear cannot express my intense longing.</item>
    <item>I wonder if the moon is trying to make me feel sad. Oh, I know it is not so, yet my despair is so great that I want to place the blame on the moon. My tears flow in an endless stream.</item>
    <item>Dazzling droplets of rain sit atop the leaves of the cedar tree, and the mist rises above the valley on a matchlessly beautiful fall evening.</item>
    <item>I will spend my life longing for the tiny glimpses of the love I felt on that fleeting night, short as the root of the reeds cut along the banks of Naniwa Bay.</item>
    <item>If my life must go on like this, it is better that it all ends now. Even if I go on living like this, I have no confidence that I can keep on hiding my feelings of love.</item>
    <item>Oh how I want to show him. The sleeves of the fishermen’s garb are incessantly bombarded by the waves, but the color of the dye does not change. Yet I have cried so much that the hue of my sleeves pales to what it once was.</item>
    <item>The crickets are singing and the mist is rising on this cool night. Am I to sleep alone on the sleeve of my kimono on this rough straw mat?</item>
    <item>My kimono sleeve is so wet with tears it is like the rock out in the ocean that does not even reveal itself when the tides are low. He may say that he knows nothing of me, but still my tears flow such that there is no time for them to dry.</item>
    <item>I know that everything in this world is forever changing, and yet my wish is for lasting peace. The scene of this tranquil beach, dotted with fishermen casting their nets into the water, has become very dear to me.</item>
    <item>The autumn winds blow through Mt.Yoshino to hail the darkness. The coldness of this town, once the capital, chills one to the bone, and even the sound of someone striking cloth on a board makes me shiver.</item>
    <item>Suffering is part of life for all living things, and no one is free from it no matter who they are. Now I live and practice the way of Buddhism at Mt. Hiei. I wish to protect all beings with the sleeve of my monk’s robe, and I pray for their happiness.</item>
    <item>The wind blows through the garden, scattering the cherry blossoms, and there are so many petals that one could mistake them for snow. Yet it is not snow that is falling; rather it is I who is fading.</item>
    <item>Waiting endlessly for my beloved, my heart burns with loneliness like the fires of the seaweed roasted along the banks of Matsuho-no-ura, the columns of smoke reaching ever upward.</item>
    <item>The breeze gently plays with the oak leaves, making the nights cool as autumn. Still, when I see the pilgrims purifying themselves in the stream flowing from the Kamigamo Shrine, I realize that summer has not yet left us.</item>
    <item>Sometimes I feel others are very dear to me, while at other times I can only reproach them. I know there is no way to make things go as I wish, and yet I am lost in the reverie of my desires.</item>
    <item>The grasses grow under the eaves of this old building of the imperial grounds, and the sight makes me nostalgic for the days of glory of the court.</item>
