Code Refactoring:
  * Use camel case for variable names.
  * Avoid holding reference to WasuramotiActivity in Karutaplayer, and use Utils.runOnUiThread instead.
  * Use scala.util.Try instead of try ... catch -> Note: fatal exception would not be catched with scala.util.Try.
  * Move fromAuto and fromSwipe inside bundle in KarutaPlayer
  * Rename JNI files
   - split folders into ogg decoding and Open SLES Player.
  * Replace `YomiInfoSearchDialog` to `YomiInfoDetailDialog`
   - also replace `yomi_info_search` to `yomi_info_detail`
  * Call unregisterOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener in somewhere not from onDestroy
   - onDestroy is only called when device is rotated or Activity is finished
   - that means that it would be not called when moved from ConfActivity -> WasuramotiActivity ?
  * Include bug_report.cgi and some other related scripts inside this repository
   - raise error if there's no detail
  * Migrate to newer android-sdk-plugin.

End of Life:
  * [2017-02-23] Remove Globals.have_to_alert_ver_0_9_9 and R.string.alert_ver_0_9_9
  * [2017-02-23] Remove `skip_on_longclick` option.

    * Use Service
      - http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html
      - Use both bound and started service - we have to carefully consider lifecycle
      - Show "Now Playing" in notification bar, and Play/Stop button
        - In Android >= 5.x, able to show in lock screen ?
      - ASUS Auto-start Manager may refuse to start Service ?

  [Android N]
    * Screen Zoom

  * Migrate from Holo to Material Design when penetration rate of Android 5.x exceeds 80%
    - use AppCompat >= 22.1.0 (this will automatically emulates Material Design for lower API version devices)
    - Use colorPrimaryDark instead of setStatusBarColor
    - ActionBarActivity -> AppCompatActivity
    - Use PreferenceFragment instead for PreferenceActivity for API >= 11
      - see http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html#BackCompatHeaders
