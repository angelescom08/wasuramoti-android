Code Refactoring:
  * Use camel case for variable names.
  * Avoid holding reference to WasuramotiActivity in Karutaplayer, and use Utils.runOnUiThread instead.
  * Use scala.util.Try instead of try ... catch -> Note: fatal exception would not be catched with scala.util.Try.
  * Move fromAuto and fromSwipe inside bundle in KarutaPlayer
  * Rename JNI files
   - split folders into ogg decoding and Open SLES Player.
  * Replace `YomiInfoSearchDialog` to `YomiInfoDetailDialog`
   - also replace `yomi_info_search` to `yomi_info_detail`
  * Call unregisterOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener in somewhere not from onDestroy
   - onDestroy is only called when device is rotated or Activity is finished
   - that means that it would be not called when moved from ConfActivity -> WasuramotiActivity ?
  * Include bug_report.cgi and some other related scripts inside this repository
   - raise error if there's no detail

End of Life:
  * [2017-02-23] Remove `skip_on_longclick` option.

  * [2017-08-01] Migrate to Support v7 Preference
     - current preference-v7 is immature, so wait until August 2017.
     - http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings.html#BackCompatHeaders
     - AlertDialog -> v7.AlertDialog
     - PreferenceActivity -> v7.AppCompatActivity, v7.PreferenceFragmentCompat
     - DialogPreference -> v7.DialogPreference, v7.PreferenceDialogFragmentCompat
     - apply Wasuramoti.AppTheme for ConfActivity and NotifyTimerActivity
     - customize style and items in styles.xml and make darker theme

Future Android:

      - Use both bound and started service - we have to carefully consider lifecycle
      - Show "Now Playing" in notification bar, and Play/Stop button
        - In Android >= 5.x, able to show in lock screen ?
      - ASUS Auto-start Manager may refuse to start Service ?
