Priority High:
  * Do not fade in/out if fade length is too short.
  * Use ViewPager & Fragment instead of HorizontalScrollView which displays poem text when ViewPager becomes stable.
  * As for Utils.confirmDialog() and Utils.messageDialog() , use DialogFlagment instead of AltertDialog
    (Need to use fragment first since we have to call setTargetFragment to get the result).

  * Change the color of author.
  * Show "Wasuramoti Timer Started" on notification area.
  * Use AlarmManager.setExact() instead of AlarmManager.set() if targetSdkVersion >= 19. See document of AlarmManager for more details.
  * Show animation (maybe green count down?) on custom view of ActionBar when auto play.
  * Use OpenSL ES instead of AudioTrack since AudioTrack has a lot of bugs.
    - Add Volume Boost.
  * Bugfix: In Android 2.x, swiping Left/Right frequently when poem text displayed causes "cannot read file: ..." when decoding file.
  * Full Screen Mode
  * Change Color Theme

Priority Middle:
  * Add Option: play in arbitrary order
    -> Use val lp=getWindow.getAttributes; lp.screenBrightness = 0.1f; getWindow.setAttributes(l) to turn screen off
       (NOTE: some device locks screen and go to sleep if brightness set to 0.0f)
  * Split strings.xml since it is too long.
  * Able to customize notify timer (add new, set icons)
  * Pitch and Speed change using picola and FFT (or audio library such as RubberBand or SoundTouch)
  * Create Fuda List from camera photo

Priority Low:
  * Able to change style / theme
  * Show detail of CPU from Android.os.Build when cannot load libvorbis.so
  * Able to read .wav file in case cannot load libvorbis.so
  * Able to record the voice of the player and use it as reader
  * Score the recoded voice (whether it is as good as the official karuta reader).
