  * use AAssetManager_* and AAsset_* to access asset directry
    - http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Android_GLUT_Wrapper#Accessing_assets
    - will fix: in Android 2.x, swiping Left/Right frequently when poem text displayed causes "cannot read file: ..." when decoding file.
  * Show "Wasuramoti Timer Started" on notification area.
  * Change the color of author.
  * Solve the warnings caused by -Xlint
  * Generate wasuramoti://fudaset/ uri

Priority Medium:
  * Support MP3 audio.
  * Customize Quick Config
  * Use OpenSL ES instead of AudioTrack since AudioTrack has a lot of bugs.
    - Add Volume Boost.
  * Add Option: play in arbitrary order
  * Split strings.xml since it is too long.
  * Able to customize notify timer (add new, set icons)
  * Create Fuda List from camera photo

Priority Low:
  * Able to change style / theme
  * Able to record the voice of the player and use it as reader.
  * Score the recoded voice (whether it is as good as the official karuta reader). 
  * As for Utils.confirmDialog() and Utils.messageDialog() , use DialogFlagment instead of AltertDialog.
    (Need to use fragment first since we have to call setTargetFragment to get the result).
  * Pitch and Speed change using picola and FFT (or audio library such as RubberBand or SoundTouch)
