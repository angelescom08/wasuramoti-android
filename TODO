Code Refactoring:
  * Use camel case for variable names.
  * Avoid holding reference to WasuramotiActivity in Karutaplayer, and use Utils.runOnUiThread instead.
   - hold reference to Karutaplayer in service
  * Use scala.util.Try instead of try ... catch -> Note: fatal exception would not be catched with scala.util.Try.
  * Move fromAuto and fromSwipe inside bundle in KarutaPlayer
  * Rename JNI files
   - split folders into ogg decoding and Open SLES Player.
  * Call unregisterOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener in somewhere not from onDestroy
   - onDestroy is only called when device is rotated or Activity is finished
   - that means that it would be not called when moved from ConfActivity -> WasuramotiActivity ?
  * Include bug_report.cgi and some other related scripts inside this repository
   - raise error if there's no detail

End of Life:
  * [20XX-XX-XX] Only support API Level >= 15
      - you can use LinearLayout's android:showDividers and android:divider
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4259467/in-android-how-to-make-space-between-linearlayout-children
      - you can remove src/main/res/*-{small,normal,large} since it supports sw<N>dp, w<N>dp, h<N>dp identifier

Future Android:
  [Android 6.0]
    * Instead of searching wasuramoti_reader using Utils.walkdir(), use Storage Access Framework
      - https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider.html
    * Use Service
      - http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html
      - Use both bound and started service - we have to carefully consider lifecycle
      - Show "Now Playing" in notification bar, and Play/Stop button
        - In Android >= 5.x, able to show in lock screen ?
      - ASUS Auto-start Manager may refuse to start Service ?
    * Use MediaPlayer.setDataSource(MediaDataSource dataSource)
  [Android 7.0]
    * Screen Zoom
