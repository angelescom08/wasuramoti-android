Priority High:
  * Bugfix: In Android 2.x, swiping Left/Right frequently when poem text displayed causes "cannot read file: ..." when decoding file.
  * Do not fade in/out if fade length is too short.
  * Change the color of author.
  * Show "Wasuramoti Timer Started" on notification area.
  * Use OpenSL ES instead of AudioTrack since AudioTrack has a lot of bugs.
    - Add Volume Boost.
  * Full Screen Mode
  * Change Color Theme
  * Customize Quick Config
  * When in english mode, show Furigana in Roma-ji
    - We have to enable switching Tate-Gaki and Yoko-Gaki
  * Able To Add Current Fuda to Fuda-Set

Priority Middle:
  * Add Option: play in arbitrary order
    -> Use val lp=getWindow.getAttributes; lp.screenBrightness = 0.1f; getWindow.setAttributes(l) to turn screen off
       (NOTE: some device locks screen and go to sleep if brightness set to 0.0f)
  * Split strings.xml since it is too long.
  * Able to customize notify timer (add new, set icons)
  * Pitch and Speed change using picola and FFT (or audio library such as RubberBand or SoundTouch)
  * Create Fuda List from camera photo
  * Use ViewPager & Fragment instead of HorizontalScrollView which displays poem text when ViewPager becomes stable.

Priority Low:
  * Able to change style / theme
  * Show detail of CPU from Android.os.Build when cannot load libvorbis.so
  * Able to read .wav file in case cannot load libvorbis.so
  * Able to record the voice of the player and use it as reader
  * Score the recoded voice (whether it is as good as the official karuta reader). 
  * As for Utils.confirmDialog() and Utils.messageDialog() , use DialogFlagment instead of AltertDialog
    (Need to use fragment first since we have to call setTargetFragment to get the result).
